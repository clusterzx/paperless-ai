### Advanced Customization Options
- **Predefined Processing Rules**: Specify which documents to process based on existing tags. *(Optional)* ðŸ†•
- **Selective Tag Assignment**: Use only selected tags for processing. *(Disables the prompt dialog)* ðŸ†•
- **Custom Tagging**: Assign a specific tag (of your choice) to AI-processed documents for easy identification. ðŸ†•

### Manual Mode
- **AI-Assisted Analysis**: Manually analyze documents with AI support in a modern web interface. *(Accessible via the `/manual` endpoint)* ðŸ†•
