# Delta-AI Planning

This directory contains planning materials for Delta-AI development.

## Directory Structure

- **ideas/**: Brainstorming and conceptual features without specific timelines
  - Naming: `feature-name.md`

- **specs/**: Detailed specifications for approved features
  - Naming: `YYYY-MM-feature-name.md` (date when spec was created)

- **active/**: Features currently being implemented
  - Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md` (start date)

- **completed/**: Implemented features
  - Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (start date and completion date)

## Feature Status Workflow

1. New idea → `ideas/feature-name.md`
2. Approved with specs → `specs/YYYY-MM-feature-name.md`
3. Active development → `active/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
4. Completed → `completed/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Documentation Standards

Each feature document should include:

- Feature description and objectives
- Implementation approach
- Dependencies and requirements
- Testing approach
- Acceptance criteria
