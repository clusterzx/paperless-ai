# Adaptive Context Enhancement

## Overview

Enhance document processing with dynamic context enrichment that leverages Airtable data through a multi-stage prompt chaining architecture.

## Problem Statement

The current AI-based document processing system uses static, one-size-fits-all prompts that:
- Cannot leverage valuable structured data already in Airtable (clients, regulators, products)
- Have fixed context regardless of document complexity or type
- Require fitting all potential context within a single token limit
- Cannot perform progressive refinement based on initial findings

## Proposed Solution

Create a dynamic context injection system with prompt chaining that:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Run first-pass analysis with minimal context to identify basic document attributes, document type, and entity extraction
2. **Context Retrieval**: Query Airtable for targeted context based on initial analysis. narrow down the scope of the query based on the document type and relevant entities: clients and regulators. 
3. **Enhanced Analysis**: Re-process with enriched, relevant context for improved accuracy
4. **Progressive Refinement**: Support multiple analysis stages that narrow focus with each step:
    - stages:
        - Document type classification
        - Entity extraction
        - structured data extraction
        - field extraction
        - validation
    - strategies:
        - keyword search
        - fuzzy matching
        - regex matching
        - LLM classification

## Major Components

### Airtable Integration Service

relevant idea: [airtable-context-integration](2025-05-13-airtable-context-integration.md)

Build a dedicated service that:
- Provides efficient, cached access to Airtable data
- Implements query patterns for different relationship types
- Handles rate limiting and connection management
- Transforms Airtable data into optimal prompt context format

```javascript
// Conceptual example
class AirtableContextService {
  async getClientRegistrationsContext(clientId) {
    // Retrieve client-specific Registration data from Airtable Registration Tracking table in Registration Tracking Base.
    // return a list of registrations, with the following fields:
    // NOTE: update with actual field names
    // - client_id
    // - state_id
    // - product_id
    // - registration_id
    // - registration_type
    // - registration_status
  }
  
  async getRegulatorRegistrationsContext(state_id, ) {
    // Get all possible registrations for a specific state/document type
    // }
  
  async getProductRegistrations(client_id, state_id) {
    // Get client's product registrations for specific state. return a list of registrations, with the following fields:
  }
}
```

### Context Manager

Create a context management system that:
- Selects the most relevant context based on document content and processing stage
- Formats context for optimal AI consumption
- Prioritizes context elements when token limits are reached
- Tracks context effectiveness for future optimization

```javascript
// Conceptual example
class ContextManager {
  selectContext(documentContent, analysisStage, previousResults) {
    // Determine what context is most valuable for this stage
  }
  
  formatContextForPrompt(contextData, availableTokens) {
    // Format and prioritize context to fit token constraints
  }
}
```

### Prompt Chain Orchestrator

Build infrastructure to:
- Manage sequences of prompts with different contexts
- Pass relevant output from one stage to the next
- Handle branching logic based on confidence scores
- Aggregate results across multiple processing stages

```javascript
// Conceptual example
class PromptChainOrchestrator {
  async runChain(document, initialContext) {
    const firstStageResults = await this.runStage('initial', document, initialContext);
    
    // Get enhanced context based on first stage results
    const enhancedContext = await contextService.getEnhancedContext(firstStageResults);
    
    // Run second stage with enhanced context
    const finalResults = await this.runStage('detailed', document, enhancedContext);
    
    return finalResults;
  }
}
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Client-Specific Document Processing

Current process:
- AI tries to guess client from document content alone
- No knowledge of client's specific products or registrations
- Frequent misclassifications requiring manual correction

Enhanced process:
1. First pass identifies potential client "GreenGrow Solutions"
2. System retrieves GreenGrow's product list, state registrations, and typical document patterns from Airtable
3. Second pass uses this specific context to accurately identify document type and extract metadata
4. If needed, third pass can focus on extracting specific registration fields

### Scenario 2: Regulatory Submission Identification

Current process:
- Limited understanding of regulatory requirements per state
- Cannot connect document to specific product registrations
- Struggles with state-specific document formats

Enhanced process:
1. Initial analysis identifies document is likely from "California DPR"
2. System pulls California-specific regulatory requirements and forms
3. Second pass identifies exact form type and submission category
4. Final pass extracts relevant fields with knowledge of exact form requirements

## Implementation Considerations

- **Incremental Development**: Start with simple two-stage chains before more complex patterns
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track processing time to ensure minimal overhead
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Design system to gracefully handle API limits or data gaps
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep context provision separate from document processing logic
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement efficient caching to minimize Airtable API calls

## Success Metrics

- 30% reduction in document misclassifications
- 25% improvement in metadata extraction accuracy
- Less than 15% increase in overall processing time
- 40% reduction in manual corrections needed
