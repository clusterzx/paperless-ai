# Delta-AI Development Roadmap

## Vision

Transform Delta-AI into an intelligent document processing system that leverages structured data and multi-stage analysis to achieve higher accuracy classification and metadata extraction with minimal human intervention.

## Backlog

- **Adaptive Context Enhancement**
  - Implement dynamic context enrichment using Airtable data
  - Create multi-stage document analysis with progressive refinement
  - [Details](ideas/adaptive-context-enhancement.md)

- **ML-Based Classification Training**
  - Use successfully processed documents to improve future classifications
  - Build feedback loop for continuous improvement

- **Batch Processing Optimization**
  - Enhance performance for processing multiple documents
  - Implement parallel processing where possible

## Up Next

- **Prompt Chain Infrastructure**
  - Create a flexible framework for sequential, multi-stage document processing
  - Build state management between processing stages
  - Implement conditional branching based on intermediate results
  - [Details](ideas/prompt-chain-infrastructure.md)

- **Airtable Context Integration**
  - Build robust services to access and transform Airtable data
  - Implement domain-specific data services for clients, products, and regulations
  - Create context formatting and selection algorithms
  - [Details](ideas/airtable-context-integration.md)

## In Progress

- **Repository Documentation**
  - Create comprehensive REPO_MAP.md for codebase navigation
  - Maintain documentation for key components and workflows
  - Status: Initial version complete, needs review and expansion

## Completed

- **Branding Update**
  - Transition from Paperless-AI to Delta-AI branding
  - Update logos, documentation, and UI references

- **Paperless-ngx Permission Documentation**
  - Document requirements for Paperless-ngx API permissions
  - Create troubleshooting guide for permission-related issues

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Reduction in document misclassification rate
- **Efficiency**: Reduction in manual metadata corrections
- **Performance**: Processing time with enhanced context
- **Reliability**: Successful completion rate for document processing chains
